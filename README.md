### Motivation

I've been checking my budget and expenses using [ledger-dashboard](https://github.com/Ikke/ledger-dashboard) and org-mode babel. But they're not all in one place and some part of the check is a bit manual. My goal is to be able to both generate report and check the validity of my balances using a single command.


### Status
Currently this just contains a call wrapper for ledger-cli.
